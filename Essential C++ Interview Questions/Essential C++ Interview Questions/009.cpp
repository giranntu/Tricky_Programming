// Is it possible to have a recursive inline function?

/*
	Although you can call an inline function from within itself, 
	the compiler may not generate inline code since the compiler cannot determine the depth of recursion at compile time. 
	
	A compiler with a good optimizer can inline recursive calls till some depth fixed at compile-time 
	(say three or five recursive calls), 
	and insert non-recursive calls at compile time for cases when the actual depth gets exceeded at run time.
