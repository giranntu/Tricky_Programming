Modular code is easier to understand and modify, and lends itself more to reuse – and code reuse is valuable because it reduces development time.\n",

All the variables could potentially be modified by all the functions even if they shouldn’t be, and in order to pick unique names for all the variables, some of which might have a very similar purpose but be used by different functions, we would probably have to resort to poor naming practices. It would probably be easy to confuse these variables with each other, since it would be difficult to see which functions use which variables.\n",

In the past, some other languages, like C++, introduced a struct type which eventually became indistinguishable from a class, but which initially didn’t have any methods – only attributes. This allowed programmers to construct compound variables out of many individual variables, and was the first step towards object orientation. In Python, we often use dictionaries for ad-hoc grouping of related data.\n",

    "Inheritance can be a useful technique, but it can also be an unnecessary complication. As we have already discussed, multiple inheritance can cause a lot of ambiguity and confusion, and hierarchies which use multiple inheritance should be designed carefully to minimise this.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deep hierarchy with many layers of subclasses may be difficult to read and understand. In our first inheritance example, to understand how the Lecturer class works we have to read through three different classes instead of one. If our classes are long and split into several different files, it can be hard to figure out which subclass is responsible for a particular piece of behaviour. You should avoid creating hierarchies which are more than one or two classes deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some statically typed languages inheritance is very popular because it allows the programmer to work around some of the restrictions of static typing. If a lecturer and a student are both a kind of person, we can write a function which accepts a parameter of type Person and have it work on both lecturer and student objects because they both inherit from Person. This is known as polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python inheritance is not compulsory for polymorphism, because Python is not statically typed. A function can work on both lecturer and student objects if they both have the appropriate attributes and methods even if these objects don’t share a parent class, and are completely unrelated. When you check parameters yourself, you are encouraged not to check an object’s type directly, but instead to check for the presence of the methods and attributes that your function needs to use – that way you are not forcing the parameter objects into an inheritance hierarchy when this is unnecessary."
