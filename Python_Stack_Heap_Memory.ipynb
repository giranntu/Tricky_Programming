    "In C, when we assign a variable, we first declare it, thereby reserving a space in memory, and then store the value in the memory spot allocated. We can create another variable with the same value by repeating the process, ending up with two spots in memory, each with its own value that is equivalent to the other’s."

    "Python employs a different approach. Instead of storing values in the memory space reserved by the variable, Python has the variable refer to the value. Similar to pointers in C, variables in Python refer to values (or objects) stored somewhere in memory. In fact, ***all variable names in Python are said to be references to the values***, some of which are front loaded by Python and therefore exist before the name references occur (more on this later). Python keeps an internal counter on how many references an object has. Once the counter goes to zero — meaning that no reference is made to the object — the garbage collector in Python removes the object , thus freeing up the memory."

    "When we are talking about CPython it uses a private heap for storing objects.  \n",

    "Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager. The Python memory manager has different components which deal with various dynamic storage management aspects, like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Memory reclamation is mostly handled by reference counting. That is, the Python VM keeps an internal journal of how many references refer to an object, and automatically garbage collects it when there are no more references referring to it. In addition, there is a mechanism to break circular references (which reference counting can't handle) by detecting unreachable \"islands\" of objects, somewhat in reverse of traditional GC algorithms that try to find all the reachable objects.  \n",

    "***NOTE***: Please keep in mind that this information is CPython specific. Other python implementations, such as pypy, iron python, jython and others may differ from one another and from CPython when it comes to their implementation specifics. To understand that better, it may help to understand that there is a difference between Python the semantics (the language) and the underlying implementation."
